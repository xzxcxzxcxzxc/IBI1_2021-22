# Third note on 7/1/21, yes! I can make changes in both directions!!

# Second note from 7/1/21, I managed to get changes on the ZJE server onto GitHub but can I make changes on the website and send them back?

# Note from 7/1/21, I have cloned this repo onto the ZJE server and am now going to attempt to push it back onto GitHub.

This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2019-20.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

==============================================================================================================================================================================================

Although I had done everything in the practical, I think it is hard for me to understand the meanning of each commands. It took me alomst 4 hours to finish the first part of the practical. 

When I type "git commit -m 'balabala'", it will warn me that "please tell me who you are", and I cannot find help in the guide. So I had to search in the internet for help.

I still don't know what is "git fetch" and "git pull". 

Another question is after I type "git merge balabala", how can I read previous message?
