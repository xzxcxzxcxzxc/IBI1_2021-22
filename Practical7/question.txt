How have new cases and new deaths developed over time in the world?

in my code, Lines 26 to 32 assignment the number of new deaths and infections worldwide to the variables 'totalDeathNum' and 'totalNewCases'. 
Lines 55 to 61 is to prefect the plot.

Discussion: compare with new cases in China and world, we can find that before 2020-01-21, the infection basically only happens in China, after that, the COVID-19 spread all over the world quickly except China.
